# TODO, repeat some of the benchmarks using unix domain sockets to see impact on performance vs TCP.

# You can run the wse_uds_waitress.py inside a docker container, to get it to print something like: 

# Serving on http://unix:/tmp/wse_waitress_test.sock


# then you could benchmark it in theory but it looks like wrk doesnt support unix sockets, maybe ab or locust
# although locust is written in python, i am not sure how fast it would be, but it heard its hackable and distributed
# some ppl recommned it.



# curl works for 1 request:

# curl -X __method__ --unix-socket __sock_addr__ __resource_addr__
# example for __resource_addr__:  http:/images/json

# for the wse_uds_waitress example it would be:
curl -X GET --unix-socket /tmp/wse_waitress_test.sock http:
